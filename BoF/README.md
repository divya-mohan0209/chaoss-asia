CHAOSS (BoF) Birds of a Feather is a framework consisting of semi-informal discussion sessions held at conferences, 
where participants with shared interests come together to discuss challenges related to measuring and visualising the open source community 
and project health in various ecosystems (research, academic, government, etc.). 
This is being piloted in the Asian chapter of the CHAOSS project.
