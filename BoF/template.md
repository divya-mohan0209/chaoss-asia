# Objectives

- Identify and discuss key challenges in measuring and visualising open source community and project health within {industry/technology} ecosystems
- Explore existing qualitative and quantitative methods for holistic health assessment within {industry/technology} ecosystems
- Facilitate knowledge sharing among participants to address challenges and uncover opportunities for growth


# Structure
## Part 1: Opening and Context (5 Minutes)
A project manager introduces the session objectives, emphasising the importance of measuring and visualising open source community and project health in the {industry/technology} ecosystem. Key themes include:

Security and Sustainability: How robust community health measurement practices can help identify and mitigate risks in open source projects, ensuring secure and sustainable use within {industry/technology} 
Innovation: The role of effective measurement and visualisation strategies in fostering innovation and accelerating open source technology adoption in {industry/technology}
Collaboration: Bridging diverse teams (e.g, security, development, operations) by providing a common language and objective data within {industry/technology}

## Part 2: Participant Introductions (10 Minutes)
Attendees briefly share their expertise and involvement with {industry/technology} and open source ecosystems
Assign 2 facilitators to guide discussions. Divide participants into {number} groups

## Part 3: Framing Challenges Using “How Might We” Questions (15 Minutes)
Participants generate “How Might We” questions to identify key challenges and opportunities. 

**Some examples:**

- How might we measure project health in {industry/technology} when interactions occur across fragmented community platforms?
- How might we balance hard data with qualitative insights in {industry/technology}?
- How might we address data gaps and/or capture unique indicators of community and project health in {industry/technology}?
- How might we measure long-term engagement, onboarding effectiveness, and contributor retention in {industry/technology}?

Each participant writes 1–3 ideas on sticky notes (one idea per note)

## Part 4: Affinity Mapping (10 Minutes)
Participants group similar ideas and form clusters. 
Label clusters to reflect common themes & participants vote on the top two clusters for further exploration.

## Part 5: Feedback Prompting - Part 1 (10 Minutes)
Project manager to demonstrate a metric or visualisation tool related to the top two clusters. 

## Part 5: Final Remarks & Feedback Prompting - Part 2 (10 Minutes)
Assigned facilitators within clusters summarise findings, feedback, and key insights with participants

## Part 6: Virtual Follow-Up (Asynchronous)
Project manager compiles and publishes final results, including:

- A report capturing session insights and recommendations.
- Publish results within the agreed timeline
